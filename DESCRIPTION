Description: This package provides high-performance non-negative matrix 
    factorization (NMF) methods for SingleCellExperiment and SpatialExperiment 
    objects using the RcppML backend. It enables efficient dimensionality 
    reduction, feature extraction, and pattern discovery in single-cell and 
    spatial genomics data, with seamless integration into Bioconductor workflows.
